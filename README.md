# playing_with_riot_games_data

In this project i tried to gather data from "league of legends" "solo-queue" games, and use the data to predict which team wins by only seeing the champions each team picked. In this project i learned how to use the Riot Games API. Sadly this project was no success, but i am still presenting it to show, that i know how to use an API, similar to the Riot Games API, for the project list on my CV.
